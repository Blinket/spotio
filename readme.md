# Rdio skin for Spotify
---
I sorely miss Rdio. It was the perfect music streaming service: quality streaming, massive selection, perfect UX, beautiful UI, and wonderful social interaction features. When it was bought by Pandora, many of us were left out in the dust and were forced to choose between lesser services like Apple Music, Spotify, and Google Play Music.

**If you decided to go with Spotify but, like me, you hate the UI, you're in luckâ€”I discovered that you can skin the Spotify app with CSS.**
